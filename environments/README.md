# Environments

Reusable Postman environment templates that complement the Aqua API collections are stored here.

## Available environments

- **aqua.postman_environment.json** – Variables for the Aqua Enterprise API, including console URL, credentials, and token placeholders.
- **cspm.postman_environment.json** – Cloud Security Posture Management–specific variables.
- **sscs.postman_environment.json** – Configuration for interacting with Software Supply Chain Security endpoints.

### Getting started

Duplicate the environment that matches your deployment, populate the secrets with your tenant-specific values, and select it in Postman before calling the associated collection.
