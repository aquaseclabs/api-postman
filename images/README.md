# Images

Screenshots and artwork that support the Aqua API documentation live in this directory. They are referenced by the root `README.md` and the PDF guides inside `../docs` to illustrate setup steps.

When adding new walkthroughs or updating UI captures, store the image assets here so that other contributors can keep the documentation consistent.
